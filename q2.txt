Objects and its internal representation:
  
  Objects are created using the new keyword and a constructor function.
  An object in Javascript is a reference data types that can contain any combination of primitive data types like number,string,boolean,null,symbol as well as other objects.
  Objects are also used to implement inheritance,which is a way of creating new objects that share the properties of another object.
  
  Internal representation:
    
         The internal representaion of an object in Javascript is a collection of properties,each with name and value.The properties of an object are accessed using dot notation.
         The internal representaion of an object in Javascript is not visible to the programmer.
         The programmer can access and manipulate the properties oa an object using dot notation.

         For example,
                    cons name = person.name;
            the following code gets the value of name property of the person object.
